      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a Computer Science B.S. Graduate from Florida State University with a strong background
        in full-stack development, software design, and Agile collaboration. I’ve led C++ and Blazor projects,
        mentored peers in best practices, and built python apps ranging from song mood boards to AI-powered quizzes.
        My background in customer service enhances my ability to communicate clearly and effectively with team members, clients, and stakeholders in any setting.
