      <p>
        I’m a Computer Science student at Florida State University graduating in May 2025, with a strong background
        in full-stack development, software design, and Agile collaboration. I’ve led C++ and Blazor projects,
        mentored peers in best practices, and built apps ranging from LMS platforms to AI-powered quizzes.
